### Artist Statement

Materials: Wood, Plastic Chess Pawns, Masonite, Arduino, DC Motor, LCD Screen


By studying motion, isolation, and nonconformity, Matthias approaches its subjects in a multi-layered way and invites the viewer to see the one standing out from the crowd and not simply standing still, despite being connected to everyone else. 

Matthias is based on formal associations which comments on a unique poetic reference to Redwall’s I Am That Is. Multiple pawns are held up by the fragile machinery that connects them all. With a conceptual approach, Matthias tries to develop forms that do not follow logical criteria, but are based only on subjective associations and orthodox procession which incite the viewer to make new personal associations.

Matthias questions the conditions of appearance of a spinning pawn in the context of non-conformity culture in which refuses to comply with society's standard for normal attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs. Each cycle represents a day; the count articulates how long it has been spinning for, demonstrating that it takes time to make something out of a movement.

Matthias works directly respond to the surrounding environment and uses everyday experiences from the artist as a starting point. Often these are framed instances that would go unnoticed in their original context.


### Functionality
The piece consists of sixteen pawns arranged in a 4 by 4 manner. Fifteen of the pawns are glued to the base which prevents them from moving. The sixteenth pawn is attached to a 6V motor that rotates both clockwise and counter-clockwise. The motor changes direction every 12 seconds in order to catch the viewer’s attention and to complete a cycle of 24 seconds that aims to represent the duration of a day. The change in motor’s directions was achieved using a Quadruple Half-H Driver L293D and the circuit design show in Image 0. Additionally, the motor’s speed is controlled by a potentiometer. An LCD Screen was attached to showcase the number of days that the pawn has been spinning, i.e non-conforming.
